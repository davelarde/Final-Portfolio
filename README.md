This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022-2023 apprenticeship at Cisco, during a transformative bootcamp sponsored by Multiverse. This experience was more than just a learning curve, it was a learning that reshaped my entire career.A year ago I embarked on this journey with no prior experience in the software engineering field. Today I stand confident thanks to valuable lessons I gained during my time at Cisco and during my bootcamp with Multiverse, I had the freedom to create any type of projects that now are essential for this portfolio and learning in my career.

## ABOUT ME üë©üèª‚Äçüíª


My name is Daniela Velarde. My passion for traveling had allowed me to explore different cultures and traditions around the world, and this same passion led me to change my career into software development. For the past 15 months , I have been part of the SWE Cisco Apprenticeship program, where I've dedicated myself to this transformative journey, focusing in improving my skills and knowledge in software development and cybersecurity.

My decision to transition into software development was motivated by my desire to combine my love for travel with my passion for technology. I believe that technology has the power to break barriers, connect people , and enhance cross-cultural understanding. Getting into the world of programming and cybersecurity, I aim to create innovative solutions that not only enrich the travel experience for individuals for also ensure their safety and privacy in the digital world, not only related in travel , but also business solutions around the world.



My professional journey is fueled by my enthusiasm for continuous learning and growth. I am particularly intrigued by the dynamic field of software development, where creativity meets technology to solve problems. Addittionally my interest to keep learning and growing in cybersecurity has increased throughout my career. So looking forward to grow in that area.
I am excited about the future possibilities that lie ahead for me in this field, and I am committed to making a meaningful impact.

## Overview of Apprenticeship
- **Host Company**: Cisco
- **Duration**: 15 months
I had the privilege of being a part of the SWE Cisco Apprenticeship program in 2022, a transformative experience that provided me with a solid foundation in software development together with the Multiverse Bootcamp, where my on-job training team is PIAM(Provisioning, Identity, Access,Management), collaborating with dedicated professionals that has not only expanded my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of real-world back-end applications of software engineering and some cybersecurity practices.

### Front end Project
Front end project folder will include the front end project I've worked in a group during the Multiverse Bootcamp. The project you will find within the folder is called "Rico-Recipes" built with React.
